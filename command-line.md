Command line is the old way of talking to computers and getting computers to respond. Basically in the past, if you wanted the computer to do something, such as open a file, you would have to enter the command into the computers interface and press enter to make it open that file.  
As computers became more powerful, they created desktop icons and commands like 'close file' etc that anybody can us to create files and close files using their mouse or some keyboard short cut key in any program in a computer. This made computers easier to use by everyone. However, for people who design these computer programs ie computer coders/programs, they need to use the old way of getting computers to follow instructions, by pressing commands in and hitting 'enter' to get computers to do certain things.
Some Command Line Tools 
pwd - print working directory. You basically use this command to 'see' where you are in a computer, especially which folder ( directory) you are in. In other words, which folder, you have open (in most cases)
cd - change directory. You can use this command to move up or down these folders.
ls - when you are in a folder/directory, you can use this command to list all the files and folders in that directory.
rmdirectory - you can use this command to delete a directory
touch - you can use this command to create a file, any file.
exit - when you type in exit, you can exit the interface. I am using Terminal, so i can use exit to get out of it and stop what i am doing.
hostname - you use this command to find out what is the name of your computer.
cp - you can use this command to copy a file or a folder etc. Basically, you use this to copy :)
mv - you can use this command to move a file or a folder to another directory.
subl - I just discovered this one. You use it to open a file in the editor Sublime :)
